3sip stands for "Sudoku Solver Script in PHP". It's a simple no-nonsense script that can solve rectangular sudoku grids. 
It was created because I had the time, and needed a break.

It isn't very clever yet, and simply tries to eliminate all posibilities for each cell until only one remains.
The grid needs to be defined in the $puzzle array at the top of the script for now.

Time allowing, I am hoping to refactor this into something modular that can be used within a larger project.
